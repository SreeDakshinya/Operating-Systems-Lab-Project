            <h2>Introduction to System Calls</h2> <p>System calls are the fundamental interface between the user space and the kernel space in an operating system. They provide a way for user programs to request services from the kernel, such as reading or writing to files, creating new processes, or allocating memory.</p>

            <h2>Process Control System Calls</h2> <p>Process control system calls are used to manage processes in Linux. These include calls like `fork()` for creating a new process, `exec()` for executing a new program, `wait()` for waiting for a child process to terminate, and `exit()` for terminating a process.</p>

            <h2>Device Management System Calls</h2> <p>Device management system calls are used to interact with hardware devices in Linux. These include `ioctl()` for controlling device-specific operations, `read()` and `write()` for reading and writing to devices, and `mmap()` for mapping device memory into the process's address space.</p>

            <h2>Information Maintenance System Calls</h2> <p>Information maintenance system calls are used to retrieve or modify information about processes, files, and the system itself. Some examples are `getpid()` for getting the process ID, `stat()` for retrieving file information, `uname()` for getting system information, and `time()` for getting the current time.</p>

            <h2>Communication System Calls</h2> <p>Communication system calls are used for inter-process communication (IPC) in Linux. These include `pipe()` for creating a pipe, `socket()` for creating a socket, `shmget()` for creating a shared memory segment, and `semget()` for creating a semaphore set.</p>
